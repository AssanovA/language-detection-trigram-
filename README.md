## Language identification, using trigram identification
My approach consists of several key steps. First, I preprocess the text data by removing unnecessary characters and converting the text to lowercase. This step ensures consistency and improves the accuracy of the language identification process.

Next, I generate trigrams from the preprocessed text. Trigrams capture the linguistic characteristics of a language by considering sequences of three consecutive characters. This representation allows for efficient and effective language modeling.

To train the language identification model, I utilize a set of labeled text samples from different languages. I iterate through each text sample, extracting trigrams and counting their occurrences for each language. These trigram frequencies are stored in a language model, which serves as the basis for language identification.

For language identification, the model takes an input text, preprocesses it, and generates trigrams. The trigrams are then compared against the trigram frequencies in the language model. The language with the highest cumulative trigram frequency is identified as the most likely language of the input text.
